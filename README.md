The Best, Most Complete Mathematical Model of Human Physiology Ever Created

Do-not-read is a fork of HumMod -- a tool that simulates the complex physiology of the human body through mathematical models.

HumMod is currently “the best, most complete, mathematical model of human physiology ever created” 
(hummod.org). It is based on the work of Dr. Arthur Guyton, who began the quest to create a tool that 
could simulate the complex human physiology through mathematical equations in the 1970s.

Thus, “HumMod is the product of over 40 years of basic physiology research. Over those years, a database of 
documents and files was amassed. These documents and files support model assumptions and equations” 
(Hester et al., 2011a; 2011b). HumMod is heavily based on Guyton and Hall, Textbook of Medical 
Physiology (Hall, 2011).

It models a fourteen organ system bound together with circulatory, endocrine, 
and neural systems. The model is composed of 10,420 variables spread over 2,335 blocks. Each block is a 
collection of ordered commands that will be called in linear order each solution interval, comprising some 
system or subsystem.

This makes HumMod a very large simulation by cognitive science and physiology 
standards. HumMod offers the data files and equations as the documentation, but to someone who is not 
familiar with human physiology, it can be difficult to understand.
